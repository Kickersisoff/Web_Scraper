# Web_Scraper

Developed a streamlined web platform that retrieves data from multiple e-commerce websites such as Amazon and Flipkart, based on user queries. Utilized Axios to scrape HTML data and employed Cheerio, along with JQuery, to search and extract relevant information. The gathered data was then stored in a MongoDB database through Mongoose, and retrieved for display on the website. The website was designed using HTML, CSS, Express, Body Parser, Lodash and EJS.
